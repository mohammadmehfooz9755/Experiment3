# 🛒 E-Commerce Web Application (React SPA)

A responsive **multi-page e-commerce Single Page Application (SPA)** built using **React** and **React Bootstrap**, developed as part of the *Full Stack Web Development* coursework. The application demonstrates modern front-end development concepts such as component-based architecture, client-side routing, and state management.
